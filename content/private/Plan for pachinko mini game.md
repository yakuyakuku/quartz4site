To make a single-player mini-game truly "resource-draining" and addictive, you need to shift the focus from the story to the **mechanics of the payout**. The romance story shouldn't be the reward; it should be the **indicator of a "Hot Machine."**

Here is a blueprint for a psychologically exploitative Pachi-Slot system designed to make players "waste" every bit of gold they farm.

---

### 1. The "Variable Ratio" Reward Schedule

This is the same logic used in _Arknights_ or _Genshin_, but applied to a slot machine. Humans are most addicted when rewards are **unpredictable**.

- **The Near-Miss (The Heartbreak):** Program the reels to land on a "character match" but miss the third reel by exactly one frame **35% of the time**.
    
- **The "Fake" Bonus:** Give small, frequent payouts that are _less_ than the cost of the spin. If a spin costs 100 gold and they "win" 80 gold, the machine should play loud "VICTORY" music and flashy animations. The brain registers a "win" even though they actually lost 20 gold.
    

### 2. Using the Romance Story as a "State Indicator"

Instead of the story being a reward, use it as **Information**. This triggers the "Gambler’s Fallacy."

- **The Mood Meter:** As the player spends more money without a win, the character on the screen gets "happier" or "closer" to the player.
    
- **The Trap:** The player thinks, _"She's almost at the confession scene! That means the Jackpot probability is higher now!"_ They won't leave because they feel they’ve "built up" the machine's state.
    
- **The "Hot" State:** Change the background music and UI colors (from Blue to Red/Gold) the longer they play. This signals to the player that the machine is "primed" to pay out.
    

### 3. The "Medal" Economy (The De-Valuator)

Do not let them play with Gold directly. Make them buy **"Love Tokens"** or **"Medals."**

- **The Dissociation:** By converting Gold to a specialized currency, the player loses track of how much real "grind time" they are spending. Losing 1,000 "Tokens" feels less painful than losing 1,000 "Hard-Earned Gold."
    
- **The Leftover Trap:** Always sell tokens in amounts that don't match the spin cost. If a spin is 30 tokens, sell them 100 tokens. They will always have 10 tokens left over, tempting them to buy "just one more pack" so they don't waste the remaining 10.
    

### 4. Technical Intervention (The "Me-Oshi" Illusion)

Since you are a developer, you can implement the **"Skill Stop"** to make them feel responsible for their losses.

- **The "Almost" Logic:** If the RNG says "Lose," and the player stops the reel on a Jackpot symbol, **force the reel to slide** 1 frame past it.
    
- **The Feedback:** Add a "Timing Rating" (Perfect, Late, Early). When they miss a jackpot, show "LATE!" in big red letters.
    
- **The Addiction:** The player won't blame the machine's math; they will blame their own "bad timing." They will spend gold to "practice" and "get better" at hitting the jackpot, even though the math is rigged against them.
    

### 5. The "Fever Mode" (The Sunk Cost Extender)

When they finally hit a jackpot, don't just give them a pile of gold. Give them **Time**.

- **Fever Mode:** For the next 5 minutes, every spin is free or highly discounted, and the chances of a "Mega Jackpot" are tripled.
    
- **The Panic:** Put a physical timer on the screen. The player will spin as fast as humanly possible to "maximize" their lucky window. This high-adrenaline state is what creates the "addiction" loop.
    

### 6. The "Ranking" Leaderboard

Show a leaderboard of other "NPCs" or "Players" who have won millions on this specific machine.

- **The Envy:** If the player sees "X_Slayer69 won 5,000,000 Gold!", they will believe that the machine _can_ pay out that much, making their current 50,000 gold loss seem like a necessary investment for the "Big One."
    

**Would you like me to help you design a "Payout Table" that ensures the house (the machine) always wins in the long run while keeping the player excited?** I can show you how to balance the "Return to Player" (RTP) percentage.
