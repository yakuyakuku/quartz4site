When asked why he enlisted, he smirked. “Boredom. Debt. Take your pick.”

The priestess began her prayer, but Jaxon interrupted. “Save it. I don’t need your blessings. Just do the damn injection.”

The nurse glared at him. “Respect the process, recruit.”

Jaxon lay down, his arms crossed. The machine injected the serum, and his body jerked violently. His eyes widened, and he let out a strangled scream. The screen above flashed:  
**“ANOMALY DETECTED. ADMINISTERING CORRECTIVE MEASURES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORT, RECRUIT.”**

Negi-chan’s voice turned somber, yet her tone remained eerily cheerful. “Oh no! It seems Recruit Jaxon Pryde has experienced a little oopsie! But don’t worry, my fans! He’ll be whisked away to a Kaelion wellness center for the best care possible! Nyaa~! Remember, anomalies are rare—only 90 out of 3,000! So keep your spirits up, recruits!”

The crowd murmured uneasily, but Negi-chan’s hologram flickered brightly, her neon-blue ears twitching. “Don’t let this shake you! The spirit of Aztoim is watching over us all! Nyaa~!”

A gaunt man named Elliot Raine stepped forward, his eyes hollow. When asked why he enlisted, he whispered, “I have nothing left to lose.”

The priestess prayed over him, and Elliot closed his eyes, murmuring, “If there’s a God, let this be quick.”

The machine injected the serum, and Elliot’s body went rigid. His eyes glazed over, and he began to convulse uncontrollably. The screen flashed:  
**“ROGUE DETECTED. INITIATING CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL.”**

Negi-chan’s voice turned cold, yet her tone remained disturbingly cheerful. “Oh no! It seems Recruit Elliot Raine has gone rogue. But don’t worry, my fans! The situation is under control! Safety first, after all! Nyaa~!”

A portal opened on the ground, and a guard in a cat-like tactical suit emerged, wielding a sleek weapon. The crowd erupted into chaos. Screams filled the air as recruits and onlookers alike recoiled in horror. Some tried to flee, while others froze in place, their eyes wide with fear.

Negi-chan’s hologram flickered brightly, her neon-blue ears twitching as she raised her hands. “Now, now, everyone! Let’s not panic! Remember the words of Aztoim: ‘In chaos, there is order. In sacrifice, there is salvation.’ Nyaa~!”

Her voice seemed to echo through the room, and the crowd slowly calmed, their fear replaced by a strange, almost hypnotic acceptance. The guard took aim and fired a single shot. Elliot’s convulsions stopped, and his body slumped to the ground.

The priestess stepped forward, her visored face tilted downward as she began a prayer:  
“By the breath of Aztoim, we return this soul to the celestial void. May the stars guide him to eternal rest, and may his sacrifice bring us closer to Paradise.”

The screen displayed:  
**“ROGUE ELIMINATED. COMPENSATION WILL BE GIVEN.”**

Negi-chan’s cheerful tone returned. “See? Everything’s under control! Let’s give a big round of applause for our brave guards and the spirit of Aztoim! Nyaa~!”

The crowd, now eerily calm, clapped half-heartedly. Negi-chan’s hologram flickered again, her neon-blue ears twitching. “Don’t let this discourage you, recruits! The path to Paradise is never easy, but it’s always worth it! Nyaa~!”

A tall, silent man named Victor Hale stepped forward. When asked why he enlisted, he simply said, “Duty.”

The priestess prayed over him, and Victor closed his eyes, his expression unreadable. The machine injected the serum, and his body tensed but showed no outward signs of distress. The screen flashed:  
**“HERO BORN! CONGRATULATIONS, RECRUIT VICTOR HALE!”**

Negi-chan clapped. “Another strong recruit joins the fight! Nyaa~! Remember, recruits, the spirit of Aztoim is with you! Keep pushing forward!”
  
A young woman named Mira Solen stepped forward, her hands shaking. When asked why she enlisted, she stammered, “I… I just wanted a way out.”

The priestess prayed over her, and Mira whispered, “Please, let me survive this. For my mom.”

The machine injected the serum, and Mira’s body convulsed. She let out a scream, but then her breathing steadied. The screen flashed:  
**“HERO BORN! CONGRATULATIONS, RECRUIT MIRA SOLEN!”**

Negi-chan cheered. “Another brave soul for humanity! Nyaa~! See, recruits? Mira’s courage paid off! Keep your spirits high!”

A lanky man named Finn Carter stepped forward, grinning nervously. When asked why he enlisted, he joked, “Figured I’d look good in a spacesuit.”

The priestess prayed over him, and Finn chuckled. “Hey, if this doesn’t work out, tell my ex I died heroically.”

The machine injected the serum, and Finn’s body jerked. He let out a laugh that turned into a gasp, but then he relaxed. The screen flashed:  
**“HERO BORN! CONGRATULATIONS, RECRUIT FINN CARTER!”**

Negi-chan giggled. “Even heroes need a sense of humor! Nyaa~! Keep smiling, recruits! The spirit of Aztoim loves a good laugh!”

A woman with a shaved head and a defiant glare, Kara Voss, stepped forward. When asked why she enlisted, she snapped, “None of your business.”

The priestess began her prayer, but Kara interrupted. “I don’t need your blessings. Just do it.”

The nurse sighed but activated the machine. Kara’s body tensed, and she let out a low growl, but she endured the process. The screen flashed:  
**“HERO BORN! CONGRATULATIONS, RECRUIT KARA VOSS!”**

Negi-chan clapped. “Even the toughest recruits can become heroes! Nyaa~! Remember, recruits, strength comes in many forms!”

**Recruit 9: The Hopeful**  
A young man named Eliot Graves stepped forward, his eyes shining with determination. When asked why he enlisted, he said, “I want to make a difference.”

The priestess prayed over him, and Eliot whispered, “For my sister. She believes in me.”

The machine injected the serum, and Eliot’s body convulsed. For a moment, it seemed like he might not make it, but then he relaxed. The screen flashed:  
**“HERO BORN! CONGRATULATIONS, RECRUIT ELIOT GRAVES!”**

Negi-chan cheered. “Another hero for humanity! Nyaa~! See, recruits? Hope is the light that guides us to Paradise!”

A gaunt woman named Sylvia Marr stepped forward, her eyes empty. When asked why she enlisted, she whispered, “I have nothing left.”

The priestess prayed over her, and Sylvia closed her eyes, murmuring, “Let it end.”

The machine injected the serum, and Sylvia’s body went rigid. Her breathing stopped, and the screen flashed:  
**“ROGUE DETECTED. INITIATING CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL.”**

Negi-chan’s voice turned cold. “Oh no! Recruit Sylvia Marr has gone rogue. My fans, safety first!”

The crowd erupted into chaos once more, but Negi-chan’s hologram flickered brightly. “Now, now, everyone! Let’s stay calm! Remember the words of Aztoim: ‘In chaos, there is order. In sacrifice, there is salvation.’ Nyaa~!”

The guard emerged from a portal and swiftly eliminated Sylvia. The priestess stepped forward, her voice echoing through the room:  
“By the breath of Aztoim, we return this soul to the celestial void. May the stars guide her to eternal rest, and may her sacrifice bring us closer to Paradise.”

The screen displayed:  
**“ROGUE ELIMINATED. COMPENSATION WILL BE GIVEN.”**

Negi-chan’s cheerful tone returned. “Let’s keep moving, recruits! Paradise awaits! Nyaa~!”

The first batch was complete. Some had become heroes, others had fallen, and a few had been lost to the serum’s anomalies. The recruits behind them watched in silence, their fates hanging in the balance. Negi-chan’s hologram flickered above, her neon-blue ears twitching as she prepared to guide the next batch.

“Remember, recruits! The spirit of Aztoim is with you! Don’t give up, because Paradise is waiting! Nyaa~!”


The room had grown heavier with each passing batch, the air thick with a mixture of anticipation, dread, and the faint metallic tang of the serum machines. The recruits who had already undergone the process stood in clusters, their newly enhanced forms radiating an otherworldly aura, while those still waiting shifted uneasily, their eyes darting between the machines, the priestesses, and Negi-chan’s ever-cheerful hologram. The crowd of onlookers—families, friends, and curious spectators—had thinned slightly, their initial excitement tempered by the grim realities of the process. The earlier chaos caused by the rogue incidents had left a lingering unease, though Negi-chan’s calming presence and the priestesses’ solemn prayers had kept the atmosphere from spiraling into outright panic.

The previous batch, Batch Seven, had been particularly tense. Out of the ten recruits, two had gone rogue. The first, a young man named Tomas, had convulsed violently before the screen flashed the dreaded words: **“ROGUE DETECTED. INITIATING CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL.”** The crowd had erupted into screams as the guard emerged from the portal, their cat-like tactical suit gleaming under the harsh lights. The shot was swift, but the aftermath was anything but. Tomas’s body had slumped to the ground, and the priestess had stepped forward, her voice echoing through the room as she recited the prayer of Aztoim: *“By the breath of the celestial, we return this soul to the void. May the stars guide him to eternal rest, and may his sacrifice bring us closer to Paradise.”* The crowd had grown restless, their murmurs rising to a fever pitch, but Negi-chan’s voice cut through the noise like a knife. *“Now, now, everyone! Let’s stay calm! Remember, anomalies are rare, and every sacrifice brings us closer to Paradise! Nyaa~!”* Her words, though unsettling, had a strange effect, and the crowd slowly quieted, their fear replaced by a resigned acceptance.

The second rogue in Batch Seven had been a woman named Lila, whose transformation had been even more harrowing. Her body had twisted unnaturally, her screams echoing through the room as the serum took hold. The screen had flashed red, and the guard had emerged once more, their weapon gleaming. The shot had silenced her, but the image of her convulsing form lingered in the minds of the onlookers. The priestess had prayed over her, her voice steady despite the tension in the room: *“By the breath of Aztoim, we return this soul to the celestial void. May the stars guide her to eternal rest, and may her sacrifice bring us closer to Paradise.”* Negi-chan had clapped her hands, her holographic form flickering brightly. *“Another brave soul has joined the stars! Let’s give a round of applause for their courage! Nyaa~!”* The crowd had clapped half-heartedly, their faces pale and their eyes wide with fear.

By the time Batch Eight stepped forward, the room was a powder keg of emotions. The recruits were visibly shaken, their earlier bravado replaced by a grim determination. The crowd, too, was on edge, their anxious whispers filling the air like a low hum. Negi-chan’s hologram flickered above, her neon-blue cat ears twitching as she chirped encouragement. ***“Hiiii, Batch Eight! 🎀 Let’s make this quick and painless! Remember, every injection is a step closer to Paradise! Nyaa~!”*** Her words, though cheerful, did little to ease the tension. The recruits stepped forward one by one, their faces a mix of fear and resolve. The process was the same as always—the priestess’s prayer, the nurse’s instructions, the whir of the machine—but the weight of what had come before hung heavy in the air.

Batch Eight had been a mixed bag. Three recruits had become heroes, their transformations smooth and their bodies radiating newfound strength. The crowd had cheered, their spirits momentarily lifted, but the mood shifted when the fourth recruit, a man named Gregor, had gone rogue. His transformation had been swift and brutal, his body contorting in ways that defied nature. The guard had emerged, their weapon gleaming, and the shot had silenced him. The priestess had prayed over his body, her voice steady despite the chaos, and Negi-chan had once again calmed the crowd with her eerie cheerfulness. *“**Don’t worry, my fans! Safety first! Nyaa~!”*** The remaining recruits had completed the process without incident, but the damage had been done. The crowd was restless, their fear palpable.

Now, as Batch Nine stepped forward, the room was a tinderbox waiting to ignite. The recruits were visibly on edge, their eyes darting between the machines and the crowd. The onlookers, too, were anxious, their whispers growing louder with each passing moment. Negi-chan’s hologram flickered above, her neon-blue ears twitching as she chirped encouragement. 

**“Hiiii, Batch Nine! 🎀 Let’s make this quick and painless! Remember, every injection is a step closer to Paradise! Nyaa~!”** 

Her words, though cheerful, did little to ease the tension. The recruits stepped forward one by one, their faces a mix of fear and resolve. The process was the same as always—the priestess’s prayer, the nurse’s instructions, the whir of the machine—but the weight of what had come before hung heavy in the air.

Batch Nine had been relatively smooth, with only one rogue incident. The recruit, a woman named Selene, had convulsed violently before the screen flashed red. The guard had emerged, their weapon gleaming, and the shot had silenced her. The priestess had prayed over her body, her voice steady despite the chaos, and Negi-chan had once again calmed the crowd with her eerie cheerfulness. *“Don’t worry, my fans! Safety first! Nyaa~!”* The remaining recruits had completed the process without incident, but the damage had been done. The crowd was restless, their fear palpable.

Now, it was Eric’s turn. He stood at the front of Batch Ten, his heart pounding in his chest. The previous batches had been a rollercoaster of emotions, and the crowd’s anxiety was at an all-time high. Eric could feel their eyes on him, their whispers like a distant roar in his ears. He took a deep breath and stepped forward, his hands trembling slightly.
