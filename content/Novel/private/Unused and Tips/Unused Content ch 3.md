**Chapter 2: The Child of the Rift**  

The moon’s surface was a graveyard of jagged rock and glowing rifts, each one a wound in reality oozing black sludge. Sector X-9 was no different—a cavernous expanse of pulsating crystal and corroded machinery, where the air tasted like burnt copper and the ground squelched underfoot. You were alone, scrubbing sludge off the Array’s valves with a plasma torch that sputtered more than it burned.  

Earlier, Kiri had mocked your sword in the Rust Yard, calling it a “toilet-scrubber blade” while sharpening her own dagger. Garrus, the hulking ex-dockworker, had said nothing but tossed you a dented canteen as he passed.  

The sludge here was thicker, almost sentient. It writhed under the torch, hissing as it evaporated. You were halfway through your shift when the rift shuddered—a low, grinding groan, like tectonic plates screaming. Shadows detached from the walls. **Thedred.** Faceless humanoids, their bodies a shifting mass of sludge and fractured crystal. They moved in jerky unison, circling something on the cavern floor—a smaller figure, child-sized, its form flickering between solid and translucent. The Thedred didn’t attack. They *guarded*.  

You stood motionless, torch raised. The Thedred ignored you, their attention fixed on the Child. Its flickering form resolved for a moment—a girl in a tattered dress, eyes glowing blue. Then it dissolved back into light and shadow. You retreated, the sludge crunching under your boots.  

Back at the barracks, Kiri watched you from across the room, her dagger glinting under flickering lights. Later, at **The Rusted Gear**, a Drifter-run bar hidden behind the waste processors, you slid into a corner booth. Zev, the bartender with a violet-glowing cybernetic eye, poured you a murky drink. **“Heard you met the Child,”** he said, wiping the counter with a grease-stained rag. **“Nasty business.”**  

You leaned forward. **“What *is* it?”**  

Zev smirked. **“Quick cash for mercs. Nobles pay top credit for ’em—alive or dead. IVO denies it, but their database’s full of sightings. Military? Couldn’t care less.”**  

Garrus sat nearby, polishing his “Lucky Wrench.” He nodded at your sword. **“Rusted junk. But junk’s better than nothing.”**  

Kiri lingered by the exit. When you stepped outside, she blocked your path, pulling up her sleeve to reveal a tiny tattoo: a **black sun with nine rays**. **“I’m not one of them,”** she said flatly. **“But the Cult pays better than mercs. Tell me where the Child is.”**  

You glanced at the tattoo, then back at her. **“Cute ink. You get that at the prison block? Or is it a ‘I heart the Void’ souvenir?”**  

Her jaw tightened. **“This isn’t a joke.”**  

**“Could’ve fooled me.”** You shrugged. **“Look, if I knew where your glowing daycare project was, I’d sell the coordinates myself. But all I saw was sludge, teeth, and a lightshow. Maybe lay off the rift-dust, yeah?”**  

Kiri’s dagger twitched. **“You’re hiding something.”**  

**“And you’re bad at threats.”** You stepped around her. **“Next time, try offering a drink first. Works better than cult-brand intimidation.”**  

She grabbed your arm, her grip like a vice. **“You think you’re clever, don’t you? Sarcastic little sludge-scrubber. But I’ve seen your type before. You’ll crack.”**  

You raised an eyebrow. **“My type? What, people who don’t trust someone who dresses like a wannabe assassin and talks like a bad holovid villain? Yeah, real mystery why I’m not spilling my guts to you. You’re about as subtle as a Thedred in a china shop.”**  

Kiri’s eyes narrowed. **“You don’t know who you’re messing with.”**  

**“And you don’t know who you’re talking to.”** You leaned in, lowering your voice. **“Let me guess—you weren’t drafted, were you? You’re here because you *want* to be. Maybe you owe someone. Maybe you’re running from something. Either way, you’re not fooling anyone with that ‘tough girl’ act. So why don’t you take your dagger and your little cult tattoo and find someone else to play games with?”**  

For a moment, she looked like she might stab you. Then she smirked, a cold, humorless smile. **“You’re smarter than you look. But that won’t save you.”**  

She let go and walked away, her boots clicking against the metal floor.

|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Double Down on Sarcasm** | Kiri storms off. Later, a mercenary slips you a note: *“Watch your back. She’s connected.”* | Black Sun Cult plants a tracker on you. Thedred attacks become more frequent.          |
| **Feed False Intel**       | “It’s in Sector G-4.” Kiri’s allies waste time searching. She retaliates with sabotage.    | Mercenaries ambush you, demanding refunds. IVO intervenes, suspicious of your motives. |
| **Play Coy**               | “Maybe I’ll trade… for that dagger.” Kiri refuses, but her curiosity grows.               | She shadows you during shifts. Discovers the Child’s location on her own.             |
| **Gaslight**               | “Child? You mean the sludge rats? Yeah, saw a dozen.” Kiri doubts her own intel.          | The Black Sun Cult interrogates her for incompetence. She blames you.                 |

**Chapter 2: The Child of the Rift (Continued)**  

Kiri’s smirk faded as she turned away, her boots clicking against the metal floor. You watched her go, your hand instinctively brushing the hilt of your sword. The rusted blade felt heavier than usual, as if it sensed the tension in the air. You didn’t trust her—not with her dagger, not with her cult tattoo, and certainly not with her holier-than-thou attitude.  

You took a step toward the barracks, your mind already shifting to the next sludge-scrubbing shift. But before you could take another step, a faint *click* echoed behind you.  

Your reflexes kicked in before your brain could process the sound. You spun, your sword sliding free of its sheath in one fluid motion. Kiri’s dagger flashed in the dim light, aimed straight for your back. The blades met with a sharp *clang*, sparks flying as her dagger skidded off the rusted edge of your sword.  

For a moment, the two of you stood frozen, weapons locked. Kiri’s eyes widened in surprise, her lips parting as if she wanted to say something. You didn’t give her the chance.  

**“Nice try,”** you said, your voice flat. **“But if you’re going to stab someone in the back, maybe don’t announce it with your boots.”**  

Kiri stepped back, her dagger still raised. She looked you up and down, her expression a mix of disbelief and grudging respect. **“You’re not just a sludge-scrubber, are you?”**  

You shrugged, lowering your sword. **“And you’re not just a thief with a cult fetish. Guess we’re both full of surprises.”**  

She didn’t laugh. Instead, she tilted her head, studying you like a puzzle she couldn’t quite solve. **“That sword… it’s not just rust, is it?”**  

**“It’s whatever you want it to be,”** you replied, sheathing the blade. **“But if you’re done trying to kill me, I’ve got sludge to scrub.”**  

Kiri didn’t move. Her dagger hung loosely at her side, but her eyes were sharp, calculating. **“You’re not what I expected.”**  

**“And you’re exactly what I expected,”** you shot back. **“Dramatic, predictable, and bad at stabbing people.”**  

For a moment, it looked like she might attack again. Then she smirked, sliding her dagger back into its sheath. **“You’re lucky I like a challenge.”**  

You crossed your arms, tilting your head mockingly. **“Ahh, yeah, maybe I’ll report this to Jarek. Let’s see how much he likes your little assassination attempt.”**  

Kiri laughed, a sharp, humorless sound. **“Jarek doesn’t care about conscript squabbles. He’s got bigger problems—like keeping the Array from collapsing. But go ahead. Waste his time. See how that works out for you.”**  

She turned on her heel and walked away, her boots clicking against the metal floor. You watched her go, your grip tightening on the hilt of your sword.

The moon’s secrets grow darker, and Kiri’s curiosity grows sharper. What’s your next move? 🌑🗡️



**Chapter 2: The Child of the Rift (Continued)**  

Kiri’s laughter echoed down the corridor as she walked away, her boots clicking against the metal floor. You watched her go, your grip tightening on the hilt of your sword. The rusted blade felt heavier than usual, as if it sensed the tension in the air. You didn’t trust her—not with her dagger, not with her cult tattoo, and certainly not with her holier-than-thou attitude.  

You turned to head back to the barracks, your mind already shifting to the next sludge-scrubbing shift. But before you could take more than a few steps, a faint *click* echoed behind you.  

Your reflexes kicked in before your brain could process the sound. You spun, your sword sliding free of its sheath in one fluid motion. But this time, Kiri wasn’t behind you.  

She was in front of you.  

Her dagger pressed against your throat, the cold edge biting into your skin. Her face was inches from yours, her breath warm against your cheek. Her eyes were closed, a serene smile on her lips.  

**“Of course,”** she said softly, her voice like a razor wrapped in silk, **“if you keep pestering about this to everyone, I might do a little something like… cut your cocks off.”**  

Her eyes snapped open, and for a moment, you saw something in them—something dark and unhinged. Then she stepped back, her dagger sliding away from your throat.  

**“Just remember that,”** she said, her smile widening. She turned on her heel and walked away, her boots clicking against the metal floor.  

You stood there, your sword still in hand, the taste of adrenaline sharp on your tongue. The rusted blade felt heavier than ever, as if it were mocking you.
